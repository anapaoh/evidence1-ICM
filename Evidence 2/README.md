## Nahuatl 


Nahuatl is an ancient Mexican language that has been spoken since at least the 7th century A.D., playing a significant role in the cultural and historical development of the region. It was the language of the Aztecs, one of the most influential civilizations in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

Despite efforts by Spanish colonizers to eradicate native cultures and languages — often through violence and suppression — Nahuatl and its speakers endured. The survival of the language stands as a powerful testament to the resilience of Indigenous identity.

Today, Nahuatl is spoken by approximately 1.5 million Nahua people, primarily in central Mexico. While its number of speakers has declined, Nahuatl remains a beautiful and vital link to Mexico’s ancestral roots, reminding us of the importance of preserving Indigenous languages and honoring the diversity they represent.

“Varieties of Nahuatl are spoken by an estimated 1.5 million Nahua people, most of whom live in Central Mexico. All Nahuan languages are indigenous to Mesoamerica.”
