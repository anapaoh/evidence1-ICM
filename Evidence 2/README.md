## Nahuatl 

Nahuatl is an ancient mexican language. It is known to be spoken since at least the 7th century A.D. and it is quite important in Mexico's history. Aztecs used to speak this language and eventhough spaniards tried to errase it and kill native people when colonization ocurred, both survived.

Nowadays it is a language that very few poeple speak; yet it is a reminder and beautiful representation of our countiry's origin and the importance of keeping it alive.

"Varieties of Nahuatl are spoken by an estimated 1.5 million Nahua people, most of whom live in Central Mexico. All Nahuan languages are indigenous to Mesoamerica" (College Of Liberal Arts | The University Of Texas At Austin, s. f.).
